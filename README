Simple N900 conversations importer for N9/N950.

READ ALL THIS FILE before doing anything.

WARNINGS:
=========
1) I used this tool once (Obvious). Consider it abandoned.
2) Make sure you have no conversations. If you don't then you will get duplicates.
3) Make sure the phone is set to offline mode (I don't know what will happen if you receive
   a message while importing).
4) Importing takes a LONG time. Find something to do meanwhile and make sure the phone is charged.
5) Better to close messaging-ui otherwise it will consume precious CPU.


Notes:
======
By default the tool will import only text messages. What gets imported is decided
by the value of FILTER

FILTER is a comma delimited string. If a local account UID matches any part then it will
get imported:

SMS: ring
gtalk: 40gmail_2ecom0
skype: skype
twitter: twitter

You figure out the rest by:
sqlite3 /home/user/.rtcom-eventlogger/el-v1.db

SELECT DISTINCT(local_uid) FROM Events WHERE service_id == 2 OR service_id == 3;

If you need to import everything then change it to an empty string. It will import everything but
I don't know how messaging-ui will handle that.

I have twitter, gtalk, skype, facebook, sip and SMSs in my N900 but I'm interested only
in importing SMSs so I set it to "ring"

USAGE:
======
Compile via qmake && make (libsqlite3-dev and libcommhistory-dev).

Copy the tool to the device along with el-v1.db from your N900 (Or from an N900 backup).
Better to delete all conversations unless you can live with duplicates.

./import el-v1.db

Go find something to do.


TODO:
=====
Packaging this when I'm not lazy.
